The boot loader and kernel.

Structure
---------

The target libarch.a is a standalone static library defined by the header files
in arch/ARCH/include/ and their implementations in arch/ARCH/lib/.

The target libsys.a is a static library dependent on libarch.a defined by the
header files in include/ and their implementations in lib/.

The target boot.o is a relocatable object which contains the primary
implementation of the boot loader. It depends on libarch.a and libsys.a. It
defines the bmain symbol, which should be called by the main
architecture-dependent entry point.

The target kernel.o is like boot.o, only for the kernel. It defines the kmain
symbol, which should be called by the main architecture-dependent entry point.

The target archboot.o is a relocatable object which defines the main entry
point of the boot loader. It depends on libarch.a, libsys.a and boot.o.

The target archkernel.o is like archboot.o, only for the kernel. Their
dependencies are the same, with the exception that it relies on kernel.o
instead of boot.o.

The main targets are boot.out, stripped to boot.bin, which links archboot.o
with all its dependencies, and kernel.out, stripped to kernel.bin, which does
the same with archkernel.o.

The way the objects and libraries are linked for the boot loader and for the
kernel are respectively defined in the linker scripts located at
arch/ARCH/boot/linker.ld and arch/ARCH/kernel/linker.ld.
