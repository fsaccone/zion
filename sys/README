Kernel.

Structure
---------

Source files are referred to without file extensions. Each source file can be
in either .c or .s format, and both types may be present and linked together.

The arch/ARCH/machine/MACHINE/start source file defines the start symbol, which
is the entry point of the kernel binary.

The arch/ARCH/astart source file defines the astart symbol, which is the
function start eventually jumps to.

The src/ source files define the kernel symbol, which is the function astart
eventually jumps to.

The lib/ and arch/ARCH/lib/ source files implement the include/ header files.

The arch/ARCH/include/arch/ and arch/ARCH/machine/MACHINE/include/machine/
header files define architecture-specific and machine-specific APIs in a
non-implementation manner. The APIs are consistent across different
architectures and machines.

The arch/ARCH/machine/MACHINE/test executable is run by the "test" make target
with the kernel binary file passed as the first argument.

The include/config.h header file is generated at build time and contains some
build configuration variables as preprocessor macros.

The raminit/ source files are linked together independently to output the
raminit program, that is the first user space program which gets run by the
kernel. It is embedded to the kernel binary at build time at offset
BINARY_SIZE, which is defined in config.mk.
