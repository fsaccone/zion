Kernel.

Structure
---------

The arch/ARCH/machine/MACHINE/start.s source file defines the start symbol,
which is the entry point of the kernel binary.

The arch/ARCH/astart.s source file defines the astart symbol, which is the
function start eventually jumps to.

The interrupt/ source files define the interrupt symbol, which is the function
set as the interrupt handler by astart.

The kernel/ source files define the kernel symbol, which is the function astart
eventually jumps to.

The lib/ and arch/ARCH/lib/ source files implement the include/ header files.

The arch/ARCH/include/arch/ and arch/ARCH/machine/MACHINE/include/machine/
header files define architecture-specific and machine-specific APIs in a
non-implementation manner. The APIs are consistent across different
architectures and machines.

The config.def.h file is used to configure the kernel and is copied to
include/config.h at build time.
