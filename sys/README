Kernel.

Structure
---------

The machine/MACHINE/start.s source file defines the start symbol, which is the
entry point of the kernel binary.

The arch/ARCH/astart.s source file defines the astart symbol, which is the
function start eventually jumps to.

The src/ source files define two main symbols:

* kmain, which is the function astart eventually jumps to

* interrupt, which is set by astart as the interrupt handler

The lib/ and arch/ARCH/lib/ source files implement the include/ header files.

The arch/ARCH/include/arch/ and machine/MACHINE/include/machine/ header files
define architecture-specific and machine-specific APIs in a non-implementation
manner. The APIs are consistent across different architectures and machines.

The file machine/MACHINE/arch is a symlink to the directory of the machine
architecture.
