/sys/
=====

The kernel.

Directory structure
-------------------

Each of these directories outputs a library or an object file. They are linked
in the order listed here, so that the last has all the symbols available.

The file arch/ARCH/linker.ld is the linker script to be used for the ARCH
architecture.

- arch/ARCH/include/
- arch/ARCH/lib/

They define and implement the header files accessible through the arch/
directory. These need architecture-specific features to be implemented.

- include/
- lib/

They define and implement all the headers files which are not in arch/.

- src/

It contains the main implementation of the kernel. This defines the kmain
symbol, which should be called by the main entry point.

- arch/ARCH/kernel/

It contains the entry point to the kernel code.
